# Conflict Resolution

## Dice steps

The main resolution mechanic for most actions is a combined roll of an Attribute dice and a Skill dice. Both dices will change with the progression of the character. This progression is called a dice step. The dice steps are as follows:

`d4 > d6 > d8 > d10 > d12 > d20`

Step up means to increase the dice step by one. Step down means to decrease the dice step by one.

## Degree of success

We have 2 fixed Degrees of success and 4 variable Degrees of success. The fixed Degrees of success are: Absolute Failure and Absolute Success.
The variable Degrees of success are: Critical Failure, Failure, Success and Critical Success.

### Fixed Degrees of success

**Absolute Failure** is when all _dice_ are 1. This is the worst possible outcome.
**Absolute Success** is when all _dice_ have the highest value. This is an automatic success.

### Variable Degrees of success

**Critical Failure** is when the [Attribute Dice](#attributes) is 1 and you fail the roll. **Failure** is when you fail the roll.
**Success** is when you succeed the roll. **Critical Success** is when one of is when the [Attribute Dice](#attributes) is the highest value and you succeed the roll.

## Pushing

When ever you make a roll and fail you may choose to push the roll, re rolling all your dice. If you fail again you fail hard.

## Luck/Ghost Dice

Some effects may grant you a luck/ghost dice. This dice is rolled along side your other dice and if it is a success it counts as a success. If it is a failure it is ignored.
