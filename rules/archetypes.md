# Archetypes

Given Tomos y Tumbas is intended as a classless system with a pool of abilities to choose from, Archetypes are a way to group abilities and give them a theme. Archetypes are not meant to be restrictive, they are just a way to help you build your character.

Archetypes encompass the starting 8 experience points. Almost always spread in 1 Pillar (4xp), 1 Instinct (2xp), and 2 Echos (1xp each).
