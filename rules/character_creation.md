# Character Creation

## Attributes

Attributes are the natural abilities of your character. They are the foundation of your character and will not change much during the course of the game.

### Might

[Mig](#might) reflects the physical strength and raw power of your character. It also determines the character's effectiveness in melee combat, their ability to perform feats of strength (like moving heavy objects or breaking down doors), and potentially influence the amount of physical damage they can inflict.

### Agility

[Agi](#agility) represents a character's speed, reflexes, and overall physical dexterity. This influence the character's ability to evade attacks, perform acrobatic feats, handle delicate or intricate tasks.

### Endurance

[End](#endurance) represents a character's stamina, resilience, and overall health. It could determine the character's total health points, their resistance to disease or poison, their ability to recover from injuries or exhaustion, and how long they can exert themselves physically.

### Intellect

[Int](#intellect) reflects a character's mental acuity, knowledge, and cognitive abilities. This could influence their ability to solve puzzles, recall information, learn new skills, and possibly affect their magical abilities.

### Wisdom

[Wis](#wisdom) represents a character's intuition, perceptiveness, and common sense. It could influence the character's ability to perceive hidden details, understand and empathize with others, handle animals, or sense danger.

### Presence

[Pre](#presence) representation of a character's charisma, influence, and leadership capabilities. This might determine the character's ability to persuade, deceive, or intimidate others, their effectiveness in diplomatic situations, and possibly their ability to inspire or lead groups. It might also be tied to certain types of magic or abilities that require force of personality.

## Skills

Skills are what your character is good at. Even thought skills can be associated tightly with a specific attribute, you can ask your DM to use a different attribute for a specific skill.
For example, even thought the skill `Athletics` is usually associated with the `Might` attribute, you can ask your DM to use the `Endurance` attribute instead to show that your character is not intending to brute force their way through a problem, but rather endure it.

**Echos** are abilities that are learned and can be used multiple times.
**Perks** are temporary abilities that are gained and lost during the course of the game.

## Skill Checks

Whenever you want to try to achieve something that you and your GM agree is possible but has a chance of failure you roll a skill check. Your GM sets a fitting target number. You make a roll with your main dice and any other you want or can use. If your result is above the target you succeed

### Difficulty chart

| Difficulty | Target Number |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| Easy       | 5             |
| Medium     | 7             |
| Hard       | 9             |
| Very Hard  | 11            |
| Extreme    | 13            |

### Advantage

if your situation is favorable in some kind of way you may be granted an Advantage die (kill die is easier to get than attributed)
You roll an extra die of the granted type and choose the preferred die.

### Disadvantage

On the other hand, if the situation is not in your favor you are given a disadvantage. Roll an extra of the die and discard the highest one

### Skill Challenge

When a task involves a complex and or longer activity your GM could ask for a skill challenge where you and your party suggest skill checks to advance the task

### Skill status

some effects can impose a status on a specific attribute. This all works the same way by imposing disadvantaged on your attribute rolls and can be removed after any rest
