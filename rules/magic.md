# Magic

**Mana** is a strange force that floats all around us. Some say it's the origin of all, characters can harness **Mana**, storing it in their bodies and expending it to produce **Magic**.
**Magic** is divided in 4 knowns schools of thought: **Arcana**, **Occult**, **Primal** and **Psionic**. Each school has its own way of using **Mana** and its own set of spells.

## Learning Magic

To learn a spell you need to find a teacher or a book that teaches it. You can also try to learn it by yourself but it will take longer and be harder. Once you have learned a spell you can cast it as long as you have enough **Mana** to do so.

## Casting Magic

To cast a spell you need to spend **Mana** equal to the spell's cost. You then roll [Intellect](#intellect) + [Magic School] and if you succeed the spell is cast. If you fail you lose the **Mana** and the spell is not cast. If you roll a Critical Failure you lose the **Mana** and the spell is not cast and you take damage equal to the spell's cost.
