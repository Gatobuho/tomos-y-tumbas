## What's Tomos & Tumbas?

Tomos & Tumbas is a Table Top Roleplaying Game (TTRPG) that aims to be a simple, classless, levelless, and narrative game on a Dark Fantasy setting. Using classic dice in new ways and a robust group of systems.

## What is this not?

Tomos & Tumbas is not a game that aims to be a simulation of reality, nor a game that aims to be a game of pure chance. Even though combat has its place, it should be an equal part as the other pillars. This game isn't a hard rules game and even though minmaxing is possible, the flexibility of the system is meant to be used to create a more narrative experience. **There is no winning or losing. The idea is for friends to gather and have fun.**

## Why Tomos & Tumbas?

I look to create a game with simple math, that encourages roleplaying and storytelling, via its mechanics and systems. Giving systems to downtime, travel and opening features to all characters I believe a more natural progression of the story will occur.
