# Combat

## Initiative

When combat is inevitable parties can try to ambush using stealth. The GM can also do that by challenging your party's awareness. If any side succeeds they gain surprise letting them have a full round without the enemy party being able to react. If both sides succeed there is no surprise, both parties roll A + W to determine initiative. The party with the highest result chooses which character goes first, then the other party chooses a character, and so on.

## Attack

To attack you roll a aDice + your weapon dice. This hits if the result surpasses the target's defense. If you roll a Critical Success you hit regardless of the target's defense. If you roll a Critical Failure you miss regardless of the target's defense. Armour reduces the damage taken by the target. Weapons have a fix damage value that may be increased by your degree of success. Damages burns through Grit first and then Flesh.

## Defense

Your options when being attacked is to use Stamina to **Dodge, Parry or Block**. When you **Dodge** you roll [A] + [?] and if you succeed you take no damage. When you **Parry** you roll [A] + [Might] and if you succeed you take no damage and can make an attack. When you Block you roll [A] + [End] and if you succeed you take no damage. If you fail you take full damage. If you roll a Critical Failure you take double damage.

## Damage

Weapons have a fixed damage value. When you hit your target you do the weapons damage score and add the degree of success. Armour reduces the damage taken by the target. Damages burns through Grit first and then Flesh.
Some weapons are armor piercing and ignore armor.
Some weapons are devastating and deal double damage.
Some weapons have rend and deal 1 armor piercing damage.

## Death

When you reach 0 Grit you are broken. Your actions take double the stamina cost.
When you reach 0 Flesh you are dieing. You can only take 1 action per round.
When you reach -1 Flesh you are dead.

## Healing

When resting you recover roll [Wisdom](#wisdom) + [Endurance](#endurance) and recover that much Grit. You also recover Stamina equal to your Endurance. You can also use Medicine to heal yourself or others. To restore Flesh you need to rest ina secure location and be able to consume a full ration.
